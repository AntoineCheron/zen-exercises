title: Java 8 Streams
---

In this exercise, you will be introduced to the manipulation of a typically functional structure. This structure is the Java 8 Streams API. In order to do this, you will have to implement an utils class in both the functional and imperative way.

The goal here is to let you discover how different these two paradigms are, by practice.

If you are not familiar at all with functional programming and Java 8 Streams, I recommand you start from the Java 8 Optional API. You can do this by reading this article: http://www.baeldung.com/java-optional.

Start by cloning the project:

```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/antoinecheron/zen-exercises/trunk/functional
```

Then, open it in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ of course :) ) and go straight to the `stream_exercise` package.

You will have to implement the two classes listed below. Signatures of the methods are sufficient to know what to do.

- ParkingUtils.java
- ImperativeParkingUtils.java

In order to run your code, you can either use your IDE or gradle by typing the following code in your terminal
`./gradlew run` from the functional folder.

After you finish it, discuss your solution with at least one of your colleagues. If impossible, you'll find the correction of the exercise in the class `ParkingUtilsCorrection.java`.

#### Enjoy !
