**Hi !** Welcome at //FABERNOVEL Technologies.

This website contains exercises that you can do whenever you want. We designed them to help our newcomers become more familiar with the way we write code there.

At FABERNOVEL Technologies (Zengularity) we use the functionnal programming paradigm as it fits well with parallel programming and that the community developed a lot of great tools and abstractions that allows to do very powerful things.

As a langage, we are mainly into Scala, but with the opening of the OSS activity, we now have to accept some langages imposed by our clients. For example, at BNPP we write our code with Java 8.

The first and only exercises developed for this page are written in Java 8. If you are ready, let's dive into the functional programming exercises, [here](/zen-exercises/functional.html).
