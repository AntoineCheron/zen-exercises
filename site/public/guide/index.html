      <h1>What is it?</h1>
      <p>Padins is a web integrated developement environment for designing and running <strong>scientific simulations</strong> and more generaly any <strong>mathematic application</strong>. Simulations are represented as workflows and composed of customizable components. We have designed Padins as a scalable cloud application that can take advantage of cluster’s performance in order to run simulation fastly, but that can also be installed easily on a single pc.</p>
<p>Creating a workflow in Padins is as simple as adding 2 components on the graph : a simulation component that will contain the simulation’s code, and a visualization component. Then linking the two components together, also known as <strong>nodes</strong>, adding a few line of code in the simulation node and clicking Run. Results will be available as soon as the execution finishes in the visualisation component. </p>
<p>For the moment, Padins supports only the Python language as the programming language in the simulations’ node. In the future, it would be interested to also support R, Java, C and C++, at least. </p>
